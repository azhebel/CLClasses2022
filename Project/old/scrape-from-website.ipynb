      "Do I need a language plugin for IntelliJ IDEA or a separate IDE?\n",
      "IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate is a superset of most IntelliJ platform-based IDEs. If the bundled language plugins are enabled, it includes support for all technologies that are available within our more specific IDEs, such as PyCharm, WebStorm, PHPStorm, and so on.\n",
      "So, for example, if your application's codebase is mainly in Java, but it also uses Python scripts, we recommend using IntelliJ IDEA in combination with the bundled Python plugin. If your codebase is mainly in Python, PyCharm is the right IDE for you.\n",
      "IntelliJ IDEA editions\n",
      "IntelliJ IDEA comes in three editions:\n",
      "IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate: the commercial edition for JVM, web, and enterprise development.

EAP builds are configured to collect feature usage statistics, and are a valuable source of information for our developers. You can also report an issue if you encounter any problems.\n",
      "Release Candidate (RC) builds published before a release are also available for download, but require a paid license.\n",
      "Preview builds published after the release of a stable version that are followed by an official update, also require a paid license and cannot be evaluated for free.\n",
      "User Interface\n",

      "In IntelliJ IDEA, you have shortcuts for nearly every action, including selection and switching between the editor and various tool windows.\n",
      "Use the most useful shortcuts to invoke frequent actions without switching your focus from the editor and tune your keymap to assign custom shortcuts for your favorite commands.\n",
      "Watch this video to learn about some of the most useful shortcuts:\n",
      "Navigation and search\n",
      "IntelliJ IDEA provides quick navigation not only inside source code files but also throughout the entire project.\n",
      "One of the most useful shortcuts that is worth remembering is double Shift that brings up the Search Everywhere dialog: start typing and IntelliJ IDEA will look for your search string among all files, classes, and symbols that belong to your project, and even among the IDE actions.\n",

      "Normally, you work with a small subset of files at a time and need to switch between them quickly. The Recent Files action is a real time-saver here. Press Ctrl+E to see a list of last accessed files. Note that you can also use this action to open any tool window:\n",
      "Apart from jumping to a recent file, you can also get quick access to Recent Locations - that is code snippets you last viewed or edited. Press Ctrl+Shift+E and you'll be able to jump to a particular line you modified lately:\n",
      "File structure\n",
      "Press Ctrl+F12 to open the file structure popup that gives you an overview of all elements used in the current file and lets you jump to any of them:\n",
      "Alternatively, use the Structure tool window Alt+7\n",

      "You don't even need to bother to select anything before you apply a refactoring. IntelliJ IDEA is smart enough to figure out which statement you're going to refactor, and only asks for confirmation if several choices are possible. Just press Ctrl+Alt+Shift+T to open a list of refactorings available in the current context: \n",
      "See section Refactoring code for a full list of available refactorings with usages scenarios and the before and after examples.\n",

      "Terminal\n",
      "IntelliJ IDEA includes a built-in terminal for working with a command-line shell from inside the IDE. For example, if you're used to executing Git commands from the command line, you can run them from the Terminal instead of invoking these actions from the menu.\n",
      "The Terminal runs with your default system shell, but it also supports a number of other shells, such as cmd.exe, bash, sh, and so on.\n",
      "Build tools\n",
      "IntelliJ IDEA comes with a fully-functional Gradle and Maven integration that allows you to automate your building process, packaging, running tests, deployment, and other activities.\n",
      "When you open an existing Gradle or Maven project or create a new one, IntelliJ IDEA detects and automatically downloads all the required repositories and plugins, so you virtually don't need to configure anything and can focus solely on the development process. You can edit build.gradle and pom.xml files directly from the editor and configure the IDE to automatically sync all changes to the build configurations.\n",
      "For instructions on how to work with Gradle and Maven projects in IntelliJ IDEA, see Gradle and Maven.\n",
      "Version Control\n",
      "IntelliJ IDEA provides integration with the most popular version control tools: Git, Mercurial, Perforce, and Subversion.\n",

      "See Version control for instructions on how to configure integration with your VCS and perform the VCS-related operations.\n",
      "Local History\n",
      "Even if no version control is enabled for your project yet, you can still keep track of modifications to your project, and restore deleted files or separate changes with Local History. It acts as your personal version control system that automatically records your project's revisions triggered by various events as you edit code, run tests, deploy applications, and so on.\n",
