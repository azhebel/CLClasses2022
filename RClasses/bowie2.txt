Don't set me free, I'm as heavy as can be Just my librium and me And my E.S.T. makes three 'Cause I'd rather stay here With all the madmen Than perish with the sad men roaming free And I'd rather play here With all the madmen For I'm quite content they're all as sane as me Where can the horizon lie When a nation hides Its organic minds in a cellar, dark and grim They must be very dim Day after day They take some brain away Then turn my face around To the far side of town And tell me that it's real Then ask me how I feel Here I stand, foot in hand, talking to my wall I'm not quite right at all Don't set me free, I'm as helpless as can be My libido's split on me Gimme some good 'ole lobotomy Because I'd rather stay here With all the madmen Than perish with the sadmen roaming free And I'd rather play here With all the madmen For I'm quite content they're all as sane as me Zane, Zane, Zane, Ouvre le Chien Zane, Zane, Zane, Ouvre le Chien

Bring me more fish, throw it down by my side"" And he wants so to belch but he's too full to try So he stands up and laughs and he zips up his fly In the port of Amsterdam, you can see sailors dance Paunches bursting their pants, grinding women to porch They've forgotten the tune that their whiskey voice croaked Splitting the night with the roar of their jokes And they turn and they dance and they laugh and they lust Till the rancid sound of the accordion bursts And then out of the night with their pride in their pants And the sluts that they tow underneath the street lamps In the port of Amsterdam, there's a sailor who drinks And he drinks and he drinks and he drinks once again He'll drink to the health of the whores of Amsterdam Who've given their bodies to a thousand other men Yeah, they've bargained their virtue, their goodness all gone For a few dirty coins, well, he just can't go on Throws his nose to the sky and he aims it up above And he pisses like I cry on the unfaithful love In the port of Amsterdam In the port of Amsterdam"

Who praised Their efforts To be free? Words of strength and care And sympathy I opened doors That would have blocked Their way I braved Their cause to guide For little pay I ravaged at my finance just for Those Those whose claims were steeped in peace, tranquility Those who said a new world, new ways ever free Those whose promises stretched in hope and grace for me I bless you madly Sadly as I tie my shoes I love you badly Just in time, at times, I guess Because of you I need to rest Because it's you That sets the test So much has gone And little is new And as the sunrise stream Flickers on me My friends talk Of glory, untold dream, where all is God and God is just a word ""We had a friend, a talking man Who spoke of many powers that he had Not of the best of men, but Ours We used him We let him use his powers We let him fill Our needs Now We are strong And the road is coming to its end Now the damned have no time to make amends No purse of token fortune stands in Our way The silent guns of love Will blast the sky We broke the ruptured structure built of age Our weapons were the tongues of crying rage Where money stood We planted seeds of rebirth And stabbed the backs of fathers Sons of dirt Infiltrated business cesspools Hating through Our sleeves Yea, and We slit the Catholic throat Stoned the poor On slogans such as Wish You Could Hear Love Is All We Need Kick Out The Jams Kick Out Your Mother Cut Up Your Friend Screw Up Your Brother or He'll Get You In the End And We Know the Flag of Love is from Above And We Can Force You to Be Free And We Can Force You to Believe"" And I close my eyes and tighten up my brain For I once read a book in which the lovers were slain For they knew not the words of the Free States' refrain It said: ""I believe in the Power of Good I Believe in the State of Love I Will Fight For the Right to be Right I Will Kill for the Good of the Fight for the Right to be Right"" And I open my eyes to look around And I see a child laid slain On the ground As a love machine lumbers through desolation rows Ploughing down man, woman, listening to its command But not hearing anymore Not hearing anymore Just the shrieks from the old rich And I Want to Believe In the madness that calls 'Now' And I want to Believe That a light's shining through Somehow And I Want to Believe And You Want to Believe And We Want to Believe And We Want to Live Oh, We Want to Live We Want to Live We Want to Live We Want to Live We Want to Live I Want to Live I Want to Live I Want to Live I Want to Live I Want to Live I Want to Live Live Live Live"

 331139;Letter to American Fan, 1967;https://genius.com/David-bowie-letter-to-american-fan-1967-annotated; 5;9534;David Bowie;https://genius.com/artists/David-bowie;"PITT 25th., September 1967 Dear Sandra, When I called in this, my manager's office, a few moments ago I was handed my very first American fan letter - and it was from you. I was so pleased that I had to sit down and type an immediate reply, even though Ken is shouting at me to get on with a script he badly needs. That can wiat (wi-at? That's a new English word which means wait). I've been waiting for some reaction to the album from American listeners. There were reviews in Billboard and Cash Box, but they were by professional critics and they rarely reflect the opinions of the public. The critics were very flattering however. They even liked the single ""Love You Till Tuesday"". I've got a copy of the American album and they've printed the picture a little yellow. I'm really not that blond. I think the picture on the back is more 'me'. Hope you like those enclosed. In answer to your questions, my real name is David Jones and I don't have to tell you why I changed it. ""Nobody's going to make a monkey out of you"" said my manager. My birthday is January 8th and I guess I'm 5'10"". There is a Fan Club here in England, but if things go well in the States then we'll have one there I suppose. It's a little early to even think about it. I hope one day to get to America. My manager tells me lots about it as he has been there many times with other acts he manages. I was watching an old film on TV the other night called ""No Down Payment"" a great film, but rather depressing if it is a true reflection of The American Way Of Life. However, shortly after that they showed a documentary about Robert Frost the American poet, filmed mainly at his home in Vermont, and that evened the score. I am sure that that is nearer the real America. I made my first movie last week. Just a fifteen minutes short, but it gave me some good experience for a full length deal I have starting in January. Thankyou for being so kind as to write to me and do please write again and let me know some more about yourself. Yours sincerely, David Bowie"

The arms of the victim were pin-cushioned with 16 hypodermic needles, pumping in four major preservatives, colouring agents, memory information transport fluids and some kind of green stuff. From the last and 17th, all blood and liquid was extracted. The stomach areas was carefully flapped open and the intestines removed, disentangled and re-knitted as it were, into a small net or web and hung between the pillars of the murder-location, the grand damp doorway of Oxford Town Museum of Modern Parts, New Jersey. The Limbs of Baby were then served from the torso. Each limb was implanted with a small, highly sophisticated, binary code translator which in turn was connected to small speakers attached to far ends of each limb. The self-contained mini amplifiers were then activated, amplifying the decoded memory  info-transport substances, revealing themselves as little clue haiku's, small verses detailing memories of other brutal acts, well documented by the ROMbloids. The limbs and their components were then hung upon the splayed web, slug-like prey of some unimaginable creature. The torso, by means of its bottom-most orifice, had been placed on a small support fastened to a marble base. It was shown to warring degrees of success depending upon where one stood from behind the web but in front of the Museum door itself, acting as both signifier and guardian to the act. It was definitely murder - but was it art? All this was to be the lead-up to the most provocative event in the whole sequence of serial-events that had started around November of that same year, plunging me into the most portentous chaos-abyss that a quiet lone hacker like myself could comprehend. My name is Nathan Adler, or Detective Professor Adler in my circuit. I'm attached to the division of Art-Crime Inc., the recently instigated corporation funded by an endowment from the Arts Protectorate of London, it being felt that the investigation of art-crimes was in itself inseparable from other forms of expression and therefore worthy of support from this significant body. Nicolas Serota himself had deemed us, the small-fry of the division, worthy of an exhibit at last year's Biennale in Venice, three rooms of evidence and comparative study work which conclusively proved that the cow in Mark Tansey's ""The Innocent Bye Test"" could not differentiate between Paulus Potter's ""The Young Bull"" of 1647 (exactly 300 years before I was born, incidentally) and one of Monet's  grain stack paintings of the 1890's. The traditional art press deemed this extrapolation ""bullshit"" and removed itself to study the more formal ideas contained in Damien Hirst's ""Sheep In A Box"". Art's a farmyard. It's my job to pick thru' the manure heap looking for peppercorns. friday, december 31, 1999, 10.15 am As in any crime, my first position is to pursue the motive-gag. The recent spate, thru' '98-'99, of concept-muggings pretty much had me pulling breath for an art-murder. It was a crime whose time was now. The precedents were all there. It had probably its beginnings in the '70s with the Viennese castrationists and the blood-rituals of Nitsch. Public revulsion put the lid on that episode, but you can't keep a good down. Spurred on by Chris Burden's having himself shot by his collaborator in a gallery, tied up in a bag, thrown on a highway and then crucified upon the top of a Volkswagen, stories circulated thru' the nasty-neon of N.Y. night that a young Korean artist was the self-declared patient of wee-hours surgery in cut and run operations at not-so-secret locations in the city. If you found out about it, you could go and watch this guy having bits and pieces removed under anaesthetic. A finger-joint one night, a limb another. By the dawning of the '80s, rumour had it that he was down to a torso and one arm. He'd asked to be left in a cave in the Catskills, fed every so often by his acolytes. He didn't do much after that. I guess he read a lot. Maybe wrote a whole bunch. I suppose you can never tell what an artist will do once he's peaked. Round this same time, Bowie the singer remarked on a copula goons who frequented the Berlin bars wearing full surgery regalia; caps, aprons, rubber gloves and masks. The cutting edge. Then came Damien Hirst with the Shark-Cow-Sheep thing. No humans, palatable ritual for the world-wide public. The acceptable face of gore. Meanwhile in the US, 1994, I was in town on the night of the Athey sacrifactions. thursday,  october 27,  1994 122 east village, manhattan Ron Athey,  performance artist not for the squeamish - former heroin addict-HIV positive, pushes what looks like a knitting needle repeatedly into his forehead,  a crown of blood, must hurt like hell. Stream red dribble-dribble. No screams. Face moves in pain. Carried upstage and scrubbed down in his own blood. The water. Now dresses in nice suit and tie. Now in black T-shirt and jean, carving, with a disposable scalpel, patterns, into the back of Darryl Carlton, a black man. Bloody blotted paper towels then hung on a washing line suspended over the heads of the audience Blood-prints from life. An extremely limited edition. When it was first performed back in March. ""Four Scenes In A Harsh Life"" exploited controversy shrapnel throughout the National Endowment For the Arts. ""We have taken every precaution with our disposal systems,"" an Athey spokesperson said. ""The towels containing the blood are immediately deposited in hazardous-waste bags. Each evening, the material will be driven to a hospital for final disposal"". Athey says he is dealing with issues of self-loathing, suffering, healing and redemption. friday, december 31,  1999,  10.30 am museum of modern parts I'm drinking up the Oxford Town, New Jersey fume. Salty and acid. Maybe I can get a handle on this thing back in Soho at the bureau. It used to be Rothko's studio, now the playground for all us Art-Crime folk, AC' or ""the daubers"" as we're dubbed. Rothko himself, in a dark-deep-drunk one night, carefully removed his clothes, folded them up neatly, placing them upon a chair, lay upon the floor in a crucified position and after several attempts, found the soft blue pump of wrists and checked out. He'd held the razor blades between wads of tissue paper so that he wouldn't cut his fingers. Deep thinker. Always was. 11.00 am ""dauber""  hq,  soho The only names the Data bank can associate with Baby Grace are Leon Blank, Ramona A. Stone and Algeria Touchshriek.

Best thing to do now is feed all relevant pieces into the Mack-Verbasiser, the Metarandom programme the re-strings real life facts as improbable virtual-fact.

Now the image stack backs up and takes centre stage. Ramona A. Stone. I remember this thickness, this treacly liquid thought. But wait, I'm ahead of myself. june 15, 1977 kreutzburg,  berlin It's two in the morning. I can't sleep for the screaming of some poor ostracized Turkish immigrant screaming his guts out from over the street. His hawking shriek sounds semi-stifled like he's got a pillow over his mouth. But the desperation comes through the spongy rubber like a knife. It cuts the breeze and bangs my eardrums. I take a walk past the fabric machine, turn left onto a street with no name, The caucasian suicide centre, naked and grimy, silhouetted by fungus yellow street lamps female slashing way-out saints for a dollar a time thrown downstairs if you can't take any more. Pure joy of retreat into death, led by the shepherdess. Anti mixed-race posters pasted upon their alter of pop-death icons party people. A zero with no name looks dull-eyed to Ms. Stone, the drone that says ""in the future, everything was up to itself"". Yes. I remember Ramona. She set herself up as the no-future priestess of the Caucasian Suicide Temple, vomiting out her doctrine of death-as-eternal- party into the empty vessels of Berlin youth. The top floor rooms were the gateways to giving up to the holy ghost. She must have overseen more than 30 or 40 check-outs before the local squad twigged what was going down. october 28, 1994 New Yorker Magazine, advanced copy, celebrating fashion. It's a first of its kind since Tina Brown took over as editor. One look is all it took. It took the look and wrote a new book on what sophistaplites would take and bake. Guy Bourdin featured heavily in this new eDISHion. Since the advent of AIDS and the new morality, and, of course, his death, his dark sexy fatal style had fallen out of Vogue. An uncompromising photographer, he had found a twisty avenue through desire and death. A white female leg sticking gloomily out of a bath of black liquid enamel. Two glued up babes covered in tiny pearls. The glue prevented their skins from breathing and they pass out. ""Oh it would be beautiful."" he is to have said. ""to photograph them dead in bed."" He was a French Guy. Ha had known Man Ray. Loved Lewis Carroll. His first gig was doing hats for Vogue. He'd place dead flies or bees on the faces of the models, or, female head wears hat crushed between three skinned calves heads, tongues lolling. Well, it was the '50s, that was it was. The tight-collor '50s seen through unspeakable hostility. He wanted but he couldn't paint. So he threw globs of revengeful hatred at his mobile subjects. He would systematically pull the phone cord out of the wall. He was never to be disturbed. Disturbed. Never. Everything and everyone died around him. One shoot focusing upon a women lying in bed was said to be a reconstruction of his estranged wife's death. Another picture has a women in a phone booth making some frantic call. Her hand is pressed whitely against the glass. Behind her and outside are two female bodies partially covered by the autumn leaves. His dream, so he told his friends, was to do shoots in the morgue, with the stiffs as mannequins, I don't know. I just read this stuff. Now his spirit was being resurrected. We're mystified by blood. It's our enemy now. We don't understand it. Can't live with it. Can't , well... y'know? friday, december 31, 1999, 11.30 am After Surgery and investment in a bullet-proof mask, Ramona turned up in London, Canada as owner of a string of body-parts jewellery stores. Lamb penis necklaces, goat-scrotum purses, nipple earrings, that sort of thing. The word on the street, however, suggested that it was not in the best of interests to become one of her clients as occasionally, a customer would step into her shop and not come out again. The whistle blew after a much-loved and highly respected celebrity, known for being known, failed to show for a gallery-hanging of her mirrors. Other celebrities, equally known for being known, some only to each other, thought it was the most profound exhibit in years and couldn't take their eyes off the works. All the pieces sold within an hour, many for record prices. When the critic for Date magazine asked for an interview with the celebrity-artist, the gallery owner recalled that he hadn't seen her since earlier that day. She'd mentioned that she would be going shopping for a diamond-encrusted umbilical cord as a celebratory thing to announce her pregnancy. She would be back in an hour. Just a quick stop at the ""Gallstone"". 1986. That pregnancy would have produced a being that would be around 14 years of age. If it was still alive. To be continued...?"

He struck the ground, a cavern appeared And I smelt the burning pit of fear We crashed a thousand yards below I said, do it again, do it again (Turn around, go back!) His nebulous body swayed above His tongue swollen with devil's love The snake and I, a venom high I said, do it again, do it again (Turn around, go back!) Breathe, breathe, breathe deeply And I was seething, breathing deeply Spitting sentry, horned and tailed Waiting for you"
